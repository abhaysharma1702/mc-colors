# Minecraft Color Code Preview
Preview your text in various Minecraft color codes as well as be able to copy that text as well.

## To-Do
* [x] Implement formatting codes (ex. bold, italics, obfuscated, etc.)  
* [x] Allow color and formatting together    
* [x] Switch to RegEx for an easier and more efficient method of parsing color codes  
* [x] Add "Copy" button to easily copy text from preview boxes
* [x] Accept usage of MOTD code (ex. `\u00A70` which equates to black)  
* [ ] Implement preview of MOTD code as well as maintain raw preview of color codes  
* [ ] Add further styling to the site  
* [ ] Maybe add some additional pages?  
* [ ] Tweak obfuscated text to support more characters
